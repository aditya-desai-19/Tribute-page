        <ul class="desc">
            <li><b>Introduction</b></li>
            <p>Mahendra Singh Dhoni is an Indian former professional cricketer who was captain of the Indian national
                cricket team in limited-overs formats from 2007 to 2017 and in Test cricket from 2008 to 2014. He is a
                right handed wicket-keeper batsman.[3] He led the team to three ICC trophies including the 2007 ICC
                World Twenty20, 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup and 2013 ICC Champions Trophy.</p>
            <li><b>Early life</b></li>
            <p>Dhoni was born in Ranchi, Bihar (now in Jharkhand) and hails from a Hindu family with roots in
                Uttarakhand. Previously Dhoni was the goalkeeper for his DAV Jawahar Vidya Mandir school's football
                team,[23] but after seeing his goalkeeping skills, coach Keshav Ranjan Banerjee, one who inspired Dhoni
                to be a cricketer, picked him to play cricket for his school team. His exceptional wicketkeeping skills
                allowed him to become the regular wicketkeeper at the Commando Cricket Club (1995–1998). Based on his
                performance at club cricket, he was picked for the 1997/98 season Vinoo Mankad Trophy Under-16
                Championship, where he performed well.From 2001 to 2003, Dhoni worked as a Travelling Ticket Examiner
                (TTE) at Kharagpur railway station under South Eastern Railway in Midnapore (W), a district in West
                Bengal.</p>
            <li><b>India A team</b></li>
            <p>He was recognised for his efforts in the 2003/04 season, especially in the One Day format and was picked
                for the India A squad for a tour of Zimbabwe and Kenya.[51] Against the Zimbabwe XI in Harare Sports
                Club, Dhoni had his best wicket-keeping effort with 7 catches and 4 stumpings in the match.[52] In the
                tri-nation tournament involving Kenya, India A and Pakistan A, Dhoni helped India A chase down their
                target of 223 against Pakistan A with a half-century.[53] Continuing his good performance, he scored
                back to back centuries – 120[54] and 119*[55] – against the same team. Dhoni scored 362 runs in 6
                innings at an average of 72.40 and his performance in the series received attention from the then Indian
                captain – Sourav Ganguly[56] and Ravi Shastri, amongst others.</p>
            <li><b>International Career</b></li>
            <p>MS Dhoni was chosen to lead India in first-ever World T20 in 2007. He made his captaincy debut against
                Scotland but the match was washed off. Thereon, he led India to the ICC World Twenty 20 trophy in South
                Africa, with a victory over arch-rivals Pakistan in an intensely fought final on 24 September 2007, and
                became the second Indian captain to have won a World Cup in any form of cricket, after Kapil Dev.[132]
